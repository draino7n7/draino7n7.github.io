## Summary

I am a **Senior Software Engineer and Architect** dedicated to the mission of **Sovereign Computing**. With over **25 years** of experience spanning **US Navy Nuclear Propulsion** (20 years enlisted, Retired Senior Chief E-8) and commercial game development, I specialize in building simulation architectures that prioritize long-term sustainment over short-term licensing. My naval background taught me that mission-critical systems cannot afford vendor lock-in or "black box" dependencies. Today, I bridge the gap between indie game developers, professional studios, and defense programs by architecting the **Open Game Stack (OGS)**: a unified, dual-use development ecosystem that serves three distinct communities with a single philosophy—**ownership over subscription**.

## Experience

### **Open Game Stack (OGS)**

**Lead Architect & Founder** | *February 2026 – Present* 

* Architecting a **unified game development framework** serving three distinct communities:
  * **Indie Developers:** One-stop launcher for Godot, Blender, Krita, and Audacity. Download once, build many projects without disk bloat or version conflicts.
  * **Studios:** Team consistency at onboarding. Clone repo, launch tools—everyone gets the same exact versions. No "works on my machine" surprises.
  * **Defense & Enterprise:** Sovereignty guaranteed. No licensing servers, no vendor kill-switches. Audit the source code, run offline forever, archive the entire stack for 20+ year sustainment.

* Developing the **OGS-Launcher** (Godot 4.3 desktop application) to manage tool versions, enable "Frozen Stack" version control, and support both **Provisioning Mode** (development) and **Sovereign Mode** (air-gapped deployment).

* Leading the **"Environment as the Artifact"** initiative: versioning the entire creative toolchain alongside source code to ensure reproducibility across decades and architectures.



### **Long Wave Inc.**

**Senior Software Engineer** | *November 2024 – Present* 

* Leading the development of a **MRTS 3D-based training simulator** for the **US Navy**.

### **US Navy** (Enlisted)

**Total Service: 20 years, 1 month | Retired Senior Chief, E-8** 

* **Talent Development Manager (2017–2019):** Led senior instructors in delivering nuclear propulsion leadership courses and managed digital transformation to electronic curriculum. Certified instructor for advanced technical systems.

* **Nuclear Propulsion Plant Supervisor (2005–2017):** Served as **Reactor Control Leading Chief** (E-7) on multiple nuclear submarines (USS Newport News, USS Montpelier, USS Boise). Responsible for safe operation of nuclear reactors and mentorship of junior enlisted personnel.

* **Operations Manager:** Led teams of 11 sailors in safe, precise reactor operations, achieving 60%+ operational uptime through rigorous maintenance coordination and technical problem-solving.
